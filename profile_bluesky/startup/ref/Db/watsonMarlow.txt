This file lists and describes the database fields for the Watson Marlow
505Du stream device support.  Note the the macro $(P) here is used as a
means to substitute an installation specific part of the channel name.


### Pump On/Off Controls  - These should be fairly obvious
$(P):wm505Du:startPump
$(P):wm505Du:stopPump
$(P):wm505Du:readOnOff

#### Direction Related  -Again these are hopefully self explanitory
$(P):wm505Du:setCW
$(P):wm505Du:setCCW
$(P):wm505Du:changeDir 
$(P):wm505Du:readDir

### Speed Related
$(P):wm505Du:decr1   Reduce speed by 1rpm
$(P):wm505Du:incr1   Increase speed by 1rpm
$(P):wm505Du:loadSpeed    Set the speed to a specified number
$(P):wm505Du:readSpeed    Read back pumpspeed in RPM

### Display Related  - Relate to changing the text on the Front Panel of
### the unit
$(P):wm505Du:clearDisplay  
$(P):wm505Du:homeCursor
$(P):wm505Du:writeDisplay  A text string to write to the screen.  Note
                           that on multiple line screens ( not the one that 
			   505Du) this could be 2 lines of text separated by 
			   a '~'.  For now it is necessary to terminate this 
			   line of text with the '~' manually.

###  Configuration Readbacks - Typically there is no way to change these
###  Values read by these are read from the unit and depend on Firmware
###  Setup and values stored manually in the unit
$(P):wm505Du:readModel         Read the model # from the firmware
$(P):wm505Du:readPumpHead      Read the model of the installed pump head
$(P):wm505Du:readRate          Read the flow rate of this pump in ml/rev
                               of the pump with the installed pump and tube
$(P):wm505Du:readTubeSize      Read the size on the installed tube from
                               the system configution
$(P):wm505Du:readPumpNum       Read the pump number assigned to allow
                               reading multiple pumps from one serial line 
			       note that this is typically 1

### Dose Related  - It is possible to run the motor for a certain number
###     of tach pulses.  These channels control and monitor this.
$(P):wm505Du:Dose          The number of tach pulses to drive the pump.
			   After the pump delivers this number of
			   pulses, the pump stops automatically.  Note
			   that writing to this channel does not deliver
			   the prescribed dose.  You must process the
			   setDose record to cause this proccess to
			   start.
$(P):wm505Du:KickBack      After delivering the prescribed number of
			   pulses, it is possible to reverse the pump up
			   to 255 pulses automatically.
$(P):wm505Du:setDose       Initiate the delivery of the prescribed dose
			   defined by Dose and Kickback.
$(P):wm505Du:clearTach     Clears the tach readout
$(P):wm505Du:readTach      Readback the number of Tach pulses since the
			   last reset.  Note that if you are pumping
			   based on doses, the value here does not
			   affect dose delivery.  This is simply a
			   readback of the number of pulses.  (i.e. if
			   this reads 15000 and you set the dose to be
			   10000, the pump will still deliver an
			   additional 10000 pulses)

### Readback Control - Basically, All Readback of channel information is
###    triggered buy the readModel Record.  The scanDis is a bo record
###    that can disable this read in the event the unit is turned off or
###    or unplugged and this cannot be removed from the crate's bootup.
###    Note that 1 disables scanning and 0 enables it.
